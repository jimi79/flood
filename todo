Define what bin i will do. like one to generate an array (will return a list of strings), one to parse it (will need to read stdin) and solve it, one to display it, and so on.


flood-create # will output a list of strings of random from 0 to x for size_x and size_y


python should be able to display an array with two stdin : the initial array and the solution. 

i would like to do what ?

soluce = $(cat array | solve)

python -array arrayfile -soluce solucestring




---------

how to sort a list based on the length of strings ?

first we need to try to update

and in python i stored 1000 versions of the board....
damn




ok, i need :
one array of 1000, of strings of size like 200. that is the path
one array of integer, that is the number of cells
one array of array of array, that is the actual situation of the board for the ith path
if i need some place in an array to study a new path, then i removed the least good path already stored, based on the number of cells

by design, i avoid paths where the previous move was identical



--
doesn't work with non square matrices...
do a print that displays in a fixed place, and just update what's need to be updated

i could write a version of the program that use like 10 paths, then 100, then 1000, till it is able to match the number of steps the user is willing to use.
I also need an option like maxpath=, so that i don't have to recompile


i notice that sometimes, more max_path leads to less good results
i need to store these restuls with diff max_path values, and i'll compare the coverage with board_print.
Meaning i need to modify board_print to display the evolution of the coverage, maybe at the bottom.
like step 1, xxx% covered
step 2, xxx% covered

test if a lot of boards are similars.
maybe print out all boards after solving to get an idea
